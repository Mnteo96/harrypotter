      <h2>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h2>
      <p>
        <strong> Harry Potter </strong> has no idea how famous he is. That's
        because he's being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle who are
        terrified Harry will learn that he's really a <em>wizard</em>, just as
        his parents were. But everything changes when Harry is summoned to
        attend an infamous school for wizards, and he begins to discover some
        clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is
        greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful
        faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a
        mystical world he never knew existed and closer to his own noble
        destiny.

      <h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>
      <p>
        The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter
        wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and
        Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning
        from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry
        Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And strike it does.
        <br />
        For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors
        arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy
        Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom,
        and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.

      <h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>
      <p>
        For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous
        prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a
        single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord,
        Voldemort. Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he
        might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's
        downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his
        sleep, "He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts." Harry Potter isn't safe,
        not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his
        friends. Because on top of it all, there may be a traitor in their
        midst.

      <h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>
      <p>
        Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the
        International Quidditch Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He
        wants to dream about Cho Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than
        dream). He wants to find out about the mysterious event involving two
        other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for
        a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard.
        Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding
        standards. And in this case, different can be deadly.

      <h2>Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix</h2>
      <p>
        There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it's haunting Harry
        Potter's dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night,
        screaming in terror? It's not just the upcoming O.W.L. exams; a new
        teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a venomous, disgruntled
        house-elf; or even the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Now
        Harry Potter is faced with the unreliability of the very government of
        the magical world and the impotence of the authorities at Hogwarts.
        Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he finds depth and strength in
        his friends, beyond what even he knew; boundless loyalty; and unbearable
        sacrifice.

      <h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2>
      <p>
        The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are
        noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for
        familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of
        time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. And
        yet... As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to
        Apparate - and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins
        expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love.
        Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some
        extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.

      <h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h2>
      <p>
        In the final chapter of J.K. Rowling's magical series, Harry Potter and
        the Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron, and Hermione embark on a dangerous
        mission to destroy the secrets of Voldemort’s power. As the wizarding
        world falls into darkness, the trio must rely on their courage, loyalty,
        and friendship to face challenges that test them like never before. With
        the ultimate battle looming, Harry discovers the truth about his destiny
        and the sacrifices needed to protect those he loves. Will he rise to the
        challenge, or will the darkness prevail? This thrilling conclusion is a
        story of hope, bravery, and the fight for a better world.
